# CircularReveal Transition Animation

An example showcasing the circular reveal transition from one screen to another.

## Implementation
Look at the custom implementation of `PageRouteBuilder` in the [`first_page.dart`](https://github.com/ItzNotABug/circle_reveal_page_transition/blob/master/lib/screens/first_page.dart),\
copy the contents of `circle_reveal_clipper.dart` & `extensions.dart` from the [`utils`](https://github.com/ItzNotABug/circle_reveal_page_transition/tree/master/lib/utils) package.
